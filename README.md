MY VIM CONFIGURATION
====================

These are my configuration files for VIM and how I use it.

Setup
-----

I symlinked .vim/.vimrc and .vim/.gvimrc to the same files in the ~/ directory:

- ln -nfs ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
- ln -nfs ~/.vim/.gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

Contains
--------

- Haml/Sass support
- Markdown support

- Lusty Explorer with additional shortcuts
- Fuzzy finder
- Ack support (find in project)

- Railscasts colorscheme
- Idle Fingers colorscheme
- Better fullscreen support

- Sessions uses the .vimrc file when saved
- Change the invisibles to be more TextMate like
- Strip trailing white spaces function
